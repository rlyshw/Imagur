Imagur
======
I don't really remember what this does. I was playing around with encoding data (strings) into images with java. 


The example image in the src folder should read: 
"This is an image, but it's also words! I made this image using the RGB values of a pixel, assigning each to a single character in this input string. It's kinda cool! Each vertical strip represents three different letters. The longer the input string, the more vertical strips! Useless, in practice, but kinda fun to mess about with I guess. Making art with programming!"
